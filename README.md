# Face-Recognition-using-VGG_FaceNet
Trained a VGG net for face recognition.

## Dataset
Dataset has images of 84 individuals which includes faces of 83 celebrities and myself. Training set has 8770 images and testing set has 840 images.

##Model
I have used VGG Net which includes 13 convolutional layers, 3 fully connected layers, and ReLu, Max-Pooling, Dropout layers in between. 

##Training
For training, I have used Transfer Learning to train my network and to achieve more accuracy in fewer iterations. In the training, 
I have used the pre-trained weights instead of initializing the weights randomly i.e trained caffemodel on the same network/model but on the different dataset.
 
To use Transfer Learning, I have executed the following command from Caffe root folder to train the model.

build/tools/caffe train --solver = face_recognition/solver.prototxt --weights = face_recognition/VGG_FACE.caffemodel

Note: Below in References section, I have included the link to trained caffemodel.
